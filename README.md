# 🎬 JustWatch App
The JustWatch App uses its own endpoints to obtain information about movies and the platforms where they are available. All requests are made with the parameter "Paraguay," so it may not be very useful if you are in another country.
Since the app uses "unofficial" endpoints, it cannot be hosted due to CORS errors. However, it can be used locally.

## 💡 What is JustWatch?
JustWatch is a streaming search engine that allows users to search for and compare streaming services to find the best option for watching their favorite movies and TV shows. You can learn more about JustWatch on their [website](https://www.justwatch.com/).

## ⚙️ Usage
